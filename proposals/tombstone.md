# Tombstone page
DOI require a mechanism that provide a sustainable URL. The URL itself can change (eg: the domain used by the data center evolved).
In an article, a citation with a DOI allows to link the landing page. The information as well as the datasets access are relevant for the article content. So, in principle, the datasets having DOI should be sustainable. 


If for any unfortunate reason, the datasets is no more available, provide a *tombstone page* explaining the reasons and a link to a copy of the archive if it exists.
