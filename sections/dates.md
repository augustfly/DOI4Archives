# Dates

DataCite provides a list of terms to qualify dates such as ```Created```, ```Updated, ```Validated```, etc.
```
The dates involve the publication in the data center only.
```
 
For example, a dataset provided by a Data Center A may have been created months or even years ago and already published in a reference article or another Data Center B. In any case, the date of "Creation" is the date of creation of A.


**Note**: dates have not to be used as versioning.
