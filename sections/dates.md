# Dates

DataCite provides a list of terms to qualify dates such as "Created", "Updated, "Validated", etc.
```
These dates involves the publication in the data center only.
```
 
For instance, the "Creation" date of a dataset is the date of creation in the data center of a resource.
This dataset may have been created months or even years before andalreday beeen published in a reference article or an other data center.


Dates have not to be used as versioning. 
For instance the "Updates" is not dedicated to specify metadata update - Metadata updates has its own versioning mechanism driven by a DataCite automated process. 

For data, versioning more appropriate that "update" date, in particular for major version.
However, "Updates" date can be envisaged for evolving datasets regularly updated.
