# Dates

DataCite provides a list of terms to qualify dates such as "Created", "Updated, "Validated", etc.
```
The dates involve the publication in the data center only.
```
 
For example, a dataset shredded by a Data Center A may have been created months or even years ago and already published in a reference article or another Data Center B. In any case, the date of "Creation" is the date of creation in the Data Center A.


**Note**: dates have not to be used as versioning. 
"Updates" date is not dedicated to specify metadata update - Metadata updates has its own versioning mechanism driven by a DataCite automated process.
