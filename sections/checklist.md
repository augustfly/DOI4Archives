# Recommendation checklist
(as a first draft - please update)

1. Landing page
    - check if all DOI metadata are displayed in the landing page
    - complete the landing page with added information such as links to datasets and any other metadata used in other dissemination workflows
    - check if the landing-page is machine-readable
2. Provide curated metadata, in particular:
    - list all authors with ORCID and affiliation when they are known
    - add machine readable licence
    - add the publication date in the Data Center 
3. Check if metadata allows to generate citations (different citation usage exists)
4. Link your Datasets with resources 
   - do not misinterpret the meaning of a semantic. The relations semantic is precise, in case of doubt it is better to put nothing.
     The IVOA DCP working group can also help you: mail....
   - link the DOI with resources which are used to generate the dataset.
     For instance datasets attached to an article, or when they come from an original archive.
5. Ensure the maintenance of the DOI
6. Ensure that all your dissemination workflows are consistent, in particular:
   - with IVOA registry ?
   - with "schema.org" ?
8. Use a versioning mechanism each time your datasets evolved
   - distinguish dataset versioning (the Data Center responsability) and metadata versioning (automated versioning done by DataCite at each update)
9. Ensure the sustainability of the landing pages. 
    - If for any unfortunate reason, the datasets is no more available, provide a Tombstone page explaining the reasons.
