# Citation requirements

(I am clearly not the best person to propose that, but I give here some of my understanding)

Citation requires metadata to be serialized in bibtex, APA, ADS, etc.
The content of metadata depend of the serialisation and of the need of quality (bibtex generated by ADS is more rich than those provided by DataCite)
We will describe the mandatory items that cover the known citations and we will complete the metadata with added relevant information.

The above list of metadata are mandatory to respond to the different citation:
- identifier
- link to the dataset or landing page
- title
- year of publication
- complete authors list and possible contributors
(to complete)

See in section ?? to get more information

**Note**: DataCite provides different format that allows to check different citation output.
 
eg: ```curl -LH "Accept: application/x-bibtex" https://doi.org/10.5270/esa-1ugzkg7```
