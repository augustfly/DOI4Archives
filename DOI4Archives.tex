\begin{abstract}
Many astronomy archives are producing digital object identifiers (DOI) for datasets and services.
This document aims to summarize current workflows for creating and using DOIs, 
diagnose issues in the metadata of extant DOIs, 
and develop best practices for worklows and metadata for future DOI deployment.
This note is focused on archives in Astronomy, Planetary Science, and Heliophysics. 
Additional domains may be considered at a later time.

\section{Introduction}

\begin{enumerate}
\item General observations. 
We focus on roles of DOIs rather than the full landscape of FAIR data \citep[e.g.,][]{Wilkinson2016}. 
It is beyond the scope of this document to address all aspects of FAIRness.
We think that this document may help guide archives with achieve compliance for F.X, A.Y of the specific .
\item Describe use cases and problems for DOIs in astronomy: citation, provenance, ...
\item DOIs do not lead to data and other future problems
\item Outline of IVOA note
\item A complete listing of all astronomy/heliophysics/planetary science archvies issuing dataset (or other forms of) DOIs is given in Appendix A
\item A series of important example case studies in DataCite metadata deposits is given in Appendix B.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{admonition}{Note}
Dataset DOIs do not lead to data, or what they do lead to is widely varied.
\end{admonition}

\section{Extant use of Digital Object Identifiers in Archives}

\subsection{Collections}
\label{sec:intro:collections}


Collection-type DOIs direct users to a collection of individual data records in a particular archive.
Examples of collection-type DOIs include the DOI services provided by the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST)\footnote{\url{https://archive.stsci.edu}} \citep{2018ApJS..236...20N}, Chandra Data Archive (CDA)\footnote{\url{https://cxc.harvard.edu/cda/}} \citep{2018EPJWC.18612011R}, and the VAMDC Consortium\footnote{\url{https://vamdc.org}} Query Store service \citep{2018Galax...6..105M}.  
There is significant variation in the expected use cases for these Collection DOIs. 
There are also strong variations in the metadata of Collection-type DOIs.

Considering use-cases, both MAST and Chandra Collection DOIs collect dataset identifiers within their respective databases.
In both cases there is no expectation that these Collection DOIs would ever themselves collect attribution (i.e., be cited in the reference list of a corresponding Journal article).
However, VAMDC Collection DOIs, are intended to collect and distribute credit to the collection of database identifiers they contain.
They attempt to distribute this citation/credit to the collection of resources by "citing" all the related resources in the saved VAMDC query record.
Because this depends upon the capabilities of both the chosen DOI minting service (Zenodo) and the DataCite Schema, additional  notes on the details and the outcomes of this effort is provided in one of our case studies in Appendix B. 

Similarly the metadata of Collection DOIs vary between MAST and CDA examples. 
As described in \citet{2023ChNew..34....5D}, Chandra Data Collection DOIs create complete records of individual using \texttt{relatedIdentifier} tags and predicates. 
The metadata of MAST Collection DOIs do not provide detailed information on the individual MAST records collated in the collection.


\subsection{Datasets}
\label{sec:intro:datasets}

Examples of dataset DOIs include the IPAC, ESA, PDS, MAST etc. 
The most general use of DOIs in repositories.
It is consistent with the usage of DOIs by institutional repositories, generalist repositories (e.g., Zenodo), etc.
The dataset DOI resolves to a landing page describing the dataset.
The landing page provides one or more links to data.
The content and structure of those data links is not prescribed. 

Use cases 

\subsection{Services}
\label{sec:intro:services}

Examples of DOIs for services include IRSA (DUST).
Service DOIs lead to query tools.
They may lead to query results -- I would need examples.

Sometimes Collection DOIs act like Service DOIs but they are not.
Collection DOIs may result from queries performed at a Service.
\textbf{Warning: weeds.}

\subsection{Knowledgebases}
\label{sec:intro:kdbs}

A knowledgebase is a collection of material collated from many discrete sources.
All of the values contained in a knowledgebase have a provenance traced to other resources and have been curated into a single database for reuse.
Examples include: Simbad \citep[as originally described in, ][]{2000A&AS..143....9W}, NASA Exoplanet Archive (NEA) \citep{NEA12-doi2bib} \citep[as originally described in,][]{2013PASP..125..989A}, NASA Extragalactic Database (NED) \citep{NED1-doi2bib} \citep[as originally described in,][]{1991ASSL..171...89H}. 

Current observations about DOIs for knowledgebases include:
DOIs for knowledgebases lead users to interstitial landing pages rather than directly to the collated, curated resources.
DOIs for knowledgebases do not lead to individual values, e.g., the results of a query against that knowledgebase.
DOIs for knowledgebases never provide information in their metadata about the \textit{state} of a knowledgebase: its current version; last update; etc. 
Nor is this information on the interstitial landing pages of knowledgebases.
Services that return DOIs for queries against knowledgebase are considered Service DOIs (See Section~\ref{sec:intro:services}).
\textbf{Warning: weeds.}

\subsection{IVOA Registry}
\label{sec:intro:ivoa}
DOIs are being used in some manner by the Registry.
This includes both the indexing of DOIs related to Registry records and the minting of DOIs for Registry entries.
\textit{Until I understand this better, I consider this category distinct from any of the others.  One reason is that I fear that there is a potential mis-management of DOI services here. The publisher of a DOI is responsible for the upkeep of the digital resource. If IVOA DOI minting is providing DOIs for resources it does not manage, then this is potential mismanagement of DOI services. It is not unlike the ill-begotten aims of similar 3rd party DOI minting by \url{Re3data.Org} and \url{FAIRsharing.org} that have, for example, created DOIs for Simbad \citep{https://doi.org/10.17616/r39w29,https://doi.org/10.25504/fairsharing.rd6gxr} that really ought never be used by anyone aiming to cite Simbad for the source of their results. }

\section{Use cases and current pathologies for Dataset DOIs }

\subsection{Use Cases}
\label{sec:use:cases}

Present use cases comprise:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Providing a means for citation \& attribution
\item Enabling open data (and reuse)
\item Tracking reuse and discovering reuse modes
\end{enumerate}

Additional use cases that can be discussed as needing dataset DOIs include:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Provenance (?)
\item IVOA specific desires if different from above.
\item Reproducibility (but not really)
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Pathologies}
\label{sec:use:patho}
The primary pathology evident in DOI creation today is a mismatch between the metadata created by an archive and the use case (intended to be) implemented by that DOI. 
Succinctly, the metadata supplied by astronomy archives is often insufficient to ensure the accurate citation of the datasets.
By detailing these pathologies and triaging their less-than-desirable outcomes we can aim to develop empirically-defined best practices to guide repositories forward with the use of identifiers.
Here is a topical list of pathologies:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Incomplete metadata: missing authors, generic or misstated titles, misunderstood dates;
\item Inconsistent metadata: transmutations of metadata between systems lead to inconsistent metadata deposits;
\item (Un)versioned data: versioning is mostly nonexistent and when provided it is ill defined and often opaquely transmitted;
\item Misconceptions: DOIs do not lead to data, or what they do lead to is widely varied.
\end{enumerate}


\section{Best Practices for DOI Workflows}
\label{sec:bpwork}
\subsection{Workflows: Collections}
Include related identifiers linking the collection DOI to internal and if possible external identifiers for the dataset(s)

\subsection{Workflows: Datasets}
Include related identifiers for other sources of the data, for other digital objects that describe or contextualize the data

\subsection{Workflows: Knowledgebases}
Maybe don't use DOIs or figure out how to use them effectively to transmit \textit{state} or \textit{version} information?

\subsection{Workflows: Other}
Broad discussion of Query DOIs? 

\section{Best Practices for DOI Metadata}
\label{sec:bpmeta}
\todo{Some kind of table/graph relating meta to use case would be nice}
\subsection{Core Metadata}
\label{sec:bpmeta:core}

\paragraph{Authorship} 
Archives must decide on what mechanism will be used to transmit authorship of data records. The choices include (a) full itemization of all contributions to a dataset or collection and (b) formal use of  "collaboration/institute" names, e.g., The CANDELS collaboration. And stick to it.
If itemized then the authorship list must include all contributors to the creation of a resource, individually, ... or none of them.

\paragraph{Title} 
The title of a deposit must be unique and should describe the contents of the resource. 
Duplicating the title of a related article or dataset is easy but is not unique and almost certainly does not describe the contents of the deposit.

\paragraph{Version} 
heaven help us.

\paragraph{Dates} 
The date describes when the resource was made available on line, not when the DOI was minted. The date of the most recent update to the DOI contents and/or metadata is a different date. You can provide different kinds of dates.

\paragraph{Description} 
Consider if ADS indexes your resource. If you do not provide a description then the resource will be indexed w/o any text/abstract! Even a minimal summary is an improvement over no description/abstract.

\paragraph{Licensing and reuse permissions} 
Pretty important that the license is provided and that the license matches any other license that has been applied to these results. 
In other words, if you copy data from a resources then you can't give it a new license.
NASA wants you to use CC0.

\paragraph{Transmutations of metadata} 
If you are supplying metadata in multiple formats (on landing pages, in DataCite XML, in schema.org tags) then ensure that all forms are consistently transformed. 
There are crosswalks between these metadata schema (e.g. between DataCite and Schema.org Dataset). 
Using such crosswalks can ensure that the metadata is expressed consistently to all such services.


\subsection{Relationship Metadata}
\label{sec:bpmeta:related}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Related Identifiers
\item Predicates
\end{enumerate}

\label{sec:catalog}
\todo{Needs a lot of work to document these}

This is not an update of the \citet{2022ApJS..260....5C} appendix. 
This is meant to also provide additional information about what kinds of DOIs are minted and what types of deposits the archive will accept.

\begin{enumerate}
\item CADC
\item CDA
\item China-VO
\item ESA
\item ESO
\item IPAC

\subsection{Generalist repositories}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Dataverse
\item Dryad
\item Zenodo
\item Other?
\end{enumerate}

\begin{admonition}{Note}
All dataset citations in this document were created using BibTeX. The BibTeX for the data/service/collection DOIs is based upon the \texttt{verbatim} metadata supplied by the archive to their choice of DOI registration services as expressed by the doi2bib service\footnote{\url{https://doi2bib.org}}. The doi2bib service was selected because it does the best job protecting unfielded "author" names from complete BibTeX annihilation.
Every other reference BibTeX came from NASA ADS\footnote{\url{https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/}}.
